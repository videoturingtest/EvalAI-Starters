<p>As described in the <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00623.pdf'>research paper</a> with respect to the video understanding, we define the evaulation metrics as follows:<br><br>  
<b>Shot-level performance:</b> Shot-level QA performance on the DramaQA dataset. The questions for this level are based on a video length less than about 10 seconds without change of viewpoint.<br><br>
<b>Scene-level performance:</b> Scene-level QA performance on the DramaQA dataset. The set of questions for this level is based on clips that are 1-3 minutes long without place change.<br><br>
<b>Overall performance:</b> QA performance on the entire DramaQA dataset.
